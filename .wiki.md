# Project Summary
This project implements a Trie data structure in Java, which supports essential operations such as insertion, lookup, updating, and deletion of words. The Trie is a highly efficient way to store and retrieve strings, making it particularly useful for applications involving autocomplete features, spell checking, and prefix matching.

# Project Module Description
The main functional module of this project is the Trie, which includes:
- **Insert**: Adds a word to the Trie.
- **Lookup**: Checks if a word exists in the Trie.
- **Update**: Changes an existing word to a new word.
- **Delete**: Removes a word from the Trie.
- **Unit Tests**: Validates the functionality of the Trie operations.

# File Description Inventory
- **Trie.java**: Contains the implementation of the Trie data structure, including methods for inserting, looking up, updating, and deleting words.
- **TrieTest.java**: Contains unit tests using JUnit to verify the correctness of the Trie operations.

# Technology Stack
- Java
- JUnit (for unit testing)

# Usage
1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Java and JUnit available in your development environment.
2. **Build**: Compile the Java files using the Java compiler.
3. **Run Tests**: Execute the `TrieTest` class to run the unit tests.

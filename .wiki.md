# Project Summary
This project is a Spring Boot application designed to manage a Trie data structure for efficient string storage and retrieval. It offers essential operations like insertion, lookup, updating, and deletion of words through RESTful API endpoints. This functionality is invaluable for applications that require features such as autocomplete, spell checking, and prefix matching, making it a powerful tool for developers in text-processing applications.

# Project Module Description
The main functional modules of this project include:
- **Trie**: Implements the Trie data structure with methods for:
  - **Insert**: Adds a word to the Trie.
  - **Lookup**: Checks if a word exists in the Trie.
  - **Update**: Changes an existing word to a new word.
  - **Delete**: Removes a word from the Trie.
- **REST API Controller**: Exposes Trie operations via HTTP endpoints.
